## Meeting Time: 5:00pm PDT (UT-7), Monday July 15th, 2024.


#### Agenda:
* Intro
* Matplotlib
* Exoplanet Detection
* NASA Exoplanet Archive tutorial

### Intro

Feel free to share some of your thoughts on [Discord] to continue the discussion!

### Tutorials
1. Matplotlib
  - Scatter plot
  - histogram
  - errorbar
  - images
2. NASA Exoplanet Archive
  - What is the NASA Exoplanet Archive?
  - What kind of data does it contain?
  - How can I access the data myself?
  - How do I visualize the data?


### Discussion Questions
1. O, B, and A-type stars are the most massive (i.e. most luminous) types of stars. This means they also have the largest habitable zones (see the last figure in ["Life Outside the Solar System"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V9Aw3sex06C6Gtlo7yzfwpsQZ2VUP9BZ/view?usp=sharing)). Why, then, are they poor targets in the search for life-bearing planets?
2. How does the multiplicity of stellar systems (i.e. single stars vs binaries, triples, etc.) affect the prospects for finding life on planets?
3. If you had to distill the "ingredients" for producing intelligent life on a planet down to a short list, what would it be?
4. After reading ["Life Outside the Solar System"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V9Aw3sex06C6Gtlo7yzfwpsQZ2VUP9BZ/view?usp=sharing), has your opinion changed about whether or not we'll ever discover life around another star?

## Assignments for this Week

### I Matplotlib
Complete Exercise 1 and 2 in python notebook demonstration


### II NASA Exoplanet Archive tutorial
Complete sections 3 and 4 in the Jupyter notebook tutorial on how to use the NASA Exoplanet Archive (see instructions inside notebook).


### III Paper of the Week
Read ["Growth model interpretation of planet size distribution"](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/20/9723) by Li Zeng *et al*. Refer to our [paper reading guide](https://github.com/howardisaacson/Intro-to-Astro-2021/blob/master/Week1_Intro_unix_python/how_to_read_scientific_papers.md). Post 2-3 questions you have about this paper on our class [Discord] page. In addition, please answer at least one of your classmates' questions. You can do this anonymously if you'd like!
