These functions can be built into libraries or modules, and there are several that are used across many disciplines. For last week's assignment you worked with numpy, a library containing complex mathematical functions. Today we'll be working with pandas in this tutorial, and matplotlib in the next tutorial. Let's import those libraries here and save them in variables so that we can easily interact with them later."
